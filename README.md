# Project 1: The Opioid Epidemic in the American Southwest
* A multiple regression and clustering analysis of drug overdose mortalities as compared to demographic variables
* Demographic varaibles include: percentage of people below poverty level, median household income, percentage with a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher, percentage with a disability under 65 years, and unemployment rate
* States included in the analysis: Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico by census tracts
* Simple linear regressions and multiple regressions measured at the alpha of 0.01
* Three cluster groups identified: Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 are low risk areas while Cluster 3 is a high risk area for high drug morality rates

# Project 2: Colorado Food Deserts and Obesity
* Research questions: Which Colorado census tracts are most susceptible to being in a food desert?  How do these food desert locations compare to obesity rates?
* Data: US Census Bureau - census tract shapefile, American Community Survey - poverty 2016, ESRI - grocery store locations 2014, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment - obesity rates 2019
* Methodology: find most at risk areas (greater than 25% poverty), one mile buffer around grocery stores, erase one mile buffer from at risk areas, food deserts identfied, spatial join obesity data, compare greater than 30% obesity to potential food desert tracts
* Results: Food deserts found most commonly in suburban and rural areas, strong realtionship does exist between high obesity rates and food deserts
